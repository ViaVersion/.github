The ViaVersion suite allows server owners as well as players to allow client connections to servers of different
Minecraft versions through a bit of magicâ„¢. We support Paper, Velocity, Fabric, Forge, Bungee, Sponge and have our
own standalone proxy to join from basically any client version on any server version from the past decade.

**See [HERE](https://viaversion.com) for an overview of the different Via\* projects**.
